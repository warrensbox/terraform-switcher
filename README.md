# Terraform Switcher

The `tfswitch` command line tool lets you switch between different versions of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).  
If you do not have a particular version of Terraform installed, `tfswitch` will download and verify the version you desire.  
The installation is minimal and easy.  
Once installed, simply select the version you require from the dropdown and start using Terraform.

## NOTE

Going forward we will change the version identifier of `tfswitch` to align with the common go package versioning.  
Please be advised to change any automated implementation you might have that is relying on the `tfswitch` version string.  
**Old version string:** `0.1.2412`  
**New version string:** `v1.0.0` Note the `v` that is preceding all version numbers.
