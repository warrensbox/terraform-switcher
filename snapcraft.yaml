summary: A command line tool to switch between different versions of terraform
description: |
  The `tfswitch` command line tool lets you switch between different versions of terraform(https://www.terraform.io/).
  If you do not have a particular version of terraform installed, `tfswitch` will download the version you desire.
  The installation is minimal and easy.
  Once installed, simply select the version you require from the dropdown and start using terraform.
