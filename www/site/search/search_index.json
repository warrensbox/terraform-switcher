Select the version of terraform you require by using the up and down arrow. Hit Enter to select the desired version. The most recently selected versions are presented at the top of the dropdown. Supply version on command line You can also supply the desired version as an argument on the command line. For example, tfswitch 0.10.5 for version 0.10.5 of terraform. Hit Enter to switch. See all versions including beta, alpha and release candidates(rc) Display all versions including beta, alpha and release candidates(rc). For example, tfswitch -l or tfswitch --list-all to see all versions. Hit Enter to select the desired version. Use environment variables You can also set the TF_VERSION environment variable to your desired terraform version. For example: export TF_VERSION=0.14.4 tfswitch #will automatically switch to terraform version 0.14.4 Install latest version only Install the latest stable version only. Run tfswitch -u or tfswitch --latest . Hit Enter to install. Install latest implicit version for stable releases Install the latest implicit stable version. Ex: tfswitch -s 0.13 or tfswitch --latest-stable 0.13 downloads 0.13.6 (latest) version. Hit Enter to install. Install latest implicit version for beta, alpha and release candidates(rc) Install the latest implicit pre-release version. Ex: tfswitch -p 0.13 or tfswitch --latest-pre 0.13 downloads 0.13.0-rc1 (latest) version. Hit Enter to install. Use version.tf file If a .tf file with the terraform constrain is included in the current directory, it should automatically download or switch to that terraform version. For example, the following should automatically switch terraform to the lastest version: terraform { required_version = \">= 0.12.9\" required_providers { aws = \">= 2.52.0\" kubernetes = \">= 1.11.1\" } } Use .tfswitch.toml file (For non-admin - users with limited privilege on their computers) This is similiar to using a .tfswitchrc file, but you can specify a custom binary path for your terraform installation Create a custom binary path. Ex: mkdir /Users/warrenveerasingam/bin (replace warrenveerasingam with your username) Add the path to your PATH. Ex: export PATH=$PATH:/Users/warrenveerasingam/bin (add this to your bash profile or zsh profile) Pass -b or --bin parameter with your custom path to install terraform. Ex: tfswitch -b /Users/warrenveerasingam/bin/terraform 0.10.8 Optionally, you can create a .tfswitch.toml file in your terraform directory(current directory) OR in your home directory(~/.tfswitch.toml).
