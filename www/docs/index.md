# Introduction to tfswitch

![Logo](static/logo.png)

The `tfswitch` command-line tool lets you switch between different versions of <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">terraform</a>.
If you do not have a particular version of terraform installed, `tfswitch` lets you download the version you desire.
The installation is minimal and easy.
Once installed, simply select the version you require from the dropdown and start using terraform.
